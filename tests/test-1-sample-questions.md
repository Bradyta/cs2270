Test 1 Sample Questions
===========

This is a bunch of sample questions for test 1.

Test format
--------

This exam is worth **40 points**. It will cover the following topics:

* Programming Design Strategies
* Debugging Strategies
* Pointers
* Recursion
* Computational Complexity
* Linked Lists
* Binary Search Trees
* Sorting Algorithms

Questions will be either very short answer, or simply short
answer. _Very_ short answer means a single word, number, or multiple
choice. _Simply_ short answer means short sentences (usually less than
one) or short programs (less than 10 lines). Either way, you won't
have to write much.

Design
----------

Your pointy-haired boss (who doesn't know the first thing about
software) has cleared your next few work weeks to implement a sorting
algorithm to keep the company's widgets in order.

Do you:

1. Tell your boss that there are existing libraries that could easily
   be used to do this sort of thing, and go ahead and use said
   libraries.
2. Don't tell your boss about the libraries, but use them anyway, and
   spend those weeks 'working from home'.
3. Spend those weeks implementing a sorting algorithm from scratch,
   and then debugging it.

Answers 1 and 2 will be accepted as correct.

OK, that wasn't really a legit design question. How about this:
